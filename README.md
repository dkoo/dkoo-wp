# dkoo dot net (WP version)

This is just a WordPress adaptation of my [Meteor-based website](https://github.com/dkoo/dkoo). All basic functionality except for page transitions has been ported to WordPress equivalents. The only plug-in requirement is [WP Markdown Editor](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-markdown-editor/).

[View the demo here](http://wp.dkoo.net).

I used [VVV](https://github.com/Varying-Vagrant-Vagrants/VVV) for local development and [WP-Make](https://github.com/10up/generator-wp-make) for scaffolding.
